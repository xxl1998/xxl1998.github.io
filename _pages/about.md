Hi! I'm Xinle Xi. My research interest is about UAV, especially quadrotor.

My work and research
======
I built my first quadrotor use an APM flight controller in May 2017, when I was in my first year of undergraduate study. Then I start to build my own flight controller. In 2018, I designed my first brushed flight controller based on STM32F103RET6 and MPU6050, and I realized altitude holding flight use it.

In my graduate design, I built a new flight controller use a STM32H743IIK6 MCU with BGA package.

My background and history
======
I received my B.eng from Harbin Institute of Technology in June 2020. Then I worked for Shenzhen X-powers Technology (wholly-owned subsidiary of Allwinner Technology) from July 2020 to February 2022.

Recent research work
------
I'm building a new flight controller based on pixhawk fmuv6c and compatible to PX4-Autopilot firmware. Then I will build a quadrotor use oranepi5 and the new flight controller which could be able to realize aotonomous flight.
